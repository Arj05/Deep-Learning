# Tea Leaves Classification using CNN

**Tea Leaves Classification** is a machine learning project that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify different types of tea leaves based on their images. This project aims to streamline the identification process of various tea leaf varieties, leveraging deep learning to provide accurate results.

## Introduction

Tea leaves classification plays an important role in the tea industry, helping experts distinguish between different tea types for quality control, sorting, and grading. This project implements a CNN model to classify tea leaf images into distinct categories. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images, allowing it to learn the visual patterns of each tea type.

The CNN architecture is highly effective for image classification due to its ability to capture spatial hierarchies and complex patterns in image data. This project demonstrates the use of CNNs to solve a practical classification problem with potential applications in agriculture and industry.
